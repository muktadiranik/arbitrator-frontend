Steps to implement session-authentication using cookies on frontend:

1. backend sends the "set-cookies" header in response, which contains "csrftoken"
   and "sessionid", and browser automatically sets these cookies.

2. for cross-origin requests, "with-credentials:true" header is required 
   to force the browser to send cookies in subsequent requsets.

3. and for all the subsequent requsets, "X-CSRF" header is required in 
   request-headers, otherwise CSRF authentication would gets failed. Value for 
   X-CSRF can be fetched using seperate api that only returns "csrftoken", not 
   "sessionid"
